Java Test
=========

OpenJava is included in the virtual machine. If missing in your own environment, install either Java or Open Java version 14.

Compile and run the command line program using

``javac Hello.java ; java Hello``

Compile and run the Swing program (with native graphical user interface) using

``javac GUI.java ; java GUI``

Java *may* be offered as an option for advanced students this semester, if time permits.
