Graphical User Interface Test
=============================

Zenity is a command line application that converts its parameters into Gtk+ (gtkmm) windows and dialogs.

To run the (exceptionally simple) example, just type ``./hello.sh`` (the .sh means "shell", although it is often omitted). This tells bash to execute the file named "hello.sh" in the current directory ("./").

(Hint: You can select the above command in the editor with your mouse, then point to the terminal window and click the MIDDLE mouse button to paste it!)

The Zenity manual for the version installed in this virtual machine may be found at https://help.gnome.org/users/zenity/3.32/.
